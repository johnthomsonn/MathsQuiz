# MathsQuiz
Simple CLI Maths quiz in Python

MathsQuiz allows the player to give their name, the number of questions they would like and the maximum number that may be used for addition and subtraction (eg maxNumber=20 means max is 20+20 or 20-20), multiplication max is 10*10 and division is capped at 100/10.

The game then randomizes the questions it asks, within the parameters, and times how long the user takes to answer all of their questions.

The results are then stored in a text file in the Results folder.
